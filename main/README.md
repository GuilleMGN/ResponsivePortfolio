For this webpage, the goal was to allow all the elements and items to change and react responsively while changing screen sizes, 
allowing people on other devices to view this webpage without difficulty and maintaining the aesthetic. 
To do this we used bootstrap elements and components by adding the bootstrap CSS stylesheet link at the head of each HTML site. 
Bootstrap had its components listed on thier website which have their predefined classes to allow us to make any smaller changes on
our own CSS stylesheet also linked at the head of each HTML site. The main things used from bootstrap was the Navigation Bar settings
to allow the user to change between the 3 HTML files, and also the use of columns and rows that gave it the images and text the responsive 
layout. This also helped by reducing the use of media queries because of bootstraps way of determining container, row and column sizes are
already predefined according to the screen sizes using its grid system. Finally, I made the webpage contain my personalized information with 
images, description, and links to social medias all in their corresponding spots in each HTML file. The navbar was also set to have a button
when the screen size was small enough, which was implemented using some JavaScript. To end the webpage, bootsrap was also used for sticky footer
where position was fixed to bottom part of the screen on any size. 

The only issues I faced during this task was finding a way to have the navbar to be set only once and not have to add it at the beginning 
of each HTML file, as whenever I changed something, I would have to change for all three, and similarly with the footer. I tried to put 
most characteristics in my CSS file to organize it better. I also did my best to use semantic elements whenever possible.
